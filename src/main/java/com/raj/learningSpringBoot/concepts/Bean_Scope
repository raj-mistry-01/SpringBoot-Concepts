In Spring Framework, bean scope defines how many objects of a bean Spring creates and how long they live.

Singleton
Prototype
Request
Session

@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.)
or
@Scope("")

you can check to check bean is same or not
using hashCode


Singleton

Only one bean in all over IOC container

@Scope you can use @Scope("singleton")
 Only ONE bean instance is created
 Shared across the entire IOC container
 Default scope (even if you don’t write @Scope)

 Created at application startup
 Destroyed when application stops

 By default all are singleton when you write only @Component


Prototype
@Scope("prototype")

New object every time you request the bean
Spring does not manage destruction
Created on demand
Destroyed by JVM / GC, not Spring
lazily init


Request
Lazili init
for evry http request

You can wriet @Scope("request") on restcontroller

When you controller is having singleton and autowired dependancy has reqeust scope

this will fail to start scope

Sol. proxy mode

Seesion
One bean per user session
Same user → same object
Session ends → bean destroyed

Application

multiple IOC still same bean
Singleton is same bean across one IOC
