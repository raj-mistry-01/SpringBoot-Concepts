Suppose you have Order
which is having two child class which implemets Order interface

Now suppose you have  dependecy injection like Order order

Which one to call ??? which concrete class have to be called

Use primary annotation for that ambiguity

You can Qualifier annotation for creating some specific concrete class' bean

You have to give name to concrete class
use that name in @Qualifier
