What is autowired

It is for dependancy injection resolution

User{
    Order object
}

for User we need Order object as well

We have to spring that
when you intialize user intialize the user you might need order as well for some logic in it

This is called such as dependancy.

When you know your object is dependancy of some other object add Component to tell it is bean and

Observe the behavoir when you write the only component  or with Lazy and component

With only component it is independent bean

with lazy user will intialize first then if someone needed that object then intialize what this lazy does

you can not make immutable or final in autowired


Field injection
Setter injection
Constructor injection

With contructor injection you can acheive final Keyword means immtubale
