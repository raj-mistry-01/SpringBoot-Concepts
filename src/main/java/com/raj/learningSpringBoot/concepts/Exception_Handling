            ExcpetionHandlerExceptionResolver



Exception is resolved by the resolver classes

Dispatcher servelet

Any exception

-> HandlerExceptionResolverComposite

    -> ExcpetionHandlerExceptionResolver

    then goes if not handeled

    -> ResponseExceptionResolver

    then goes if not handled

    -> DefaultExceptionResolver


All resolver completes it's work then goes to (handled part of aboves)

defaultErrorArrtibute creates error response entity

return error reposnse


Means exception is handled left from right though resolver classes and response is created after this.

You can always write the custom error and custom throw then wrap in error reponse entity then send back

Using default provided by Spring

@ExceptionHandler annotation
if any method of controller throws exception
that will be caught by this annotation



ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver

@ExceptionHandler
@ControllerAdvice




@ExceptionHadler(ExceptionName.class)
in method pass the object of the above class
return ReponseEntity.status()



@ExcecptionHandler({ExceptionName1.class , ExceptionName2.class}) .. more than one

in method you pass the more the object of it which one was occured that will be gone
or you can pass then general object like Excpetion ex

for one controller you have to write @ExceptionHandler once for each controller - code duplication

make global handler that spring can find it and use it for global exception handling

suppose method and controllerAdvice both present then controller level is given priority.

ResponseStatusException

using @ResponseStatus on top of class defination
pass the HttpsStatus
ans in Exception body use super for the message
then will create reponse here using message and the @ResponseStatus both
status and reason both


never use ExceptionHandler and ReposnseStatus to gether
