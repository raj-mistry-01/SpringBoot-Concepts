When you write @Component

It tells the spring that  you have a bean for it and manage it's lifecycle

IOC container has the pool of objects it needed


Suppose you write

@Component

public class User{

    // Some constructor with params

}


when you write any ctor that will hide the default ctor provided by java

Now what to pass in params??? -> que for bean -> app start to failed

@Configuration
@Bean in Appconfig class

tells the spring to do not use autoconfiguration for bean but instead refer this one with params

Suppose @Bean and default both presented then -> 1st priority goes to @Bean

What if there are 2 beans which returns the User
Ans. Spring will create bean for both.


How spring boot find these Beans?
Ans. Component Scan annotation in Springbootappication run above


At what time , these beans get created?
