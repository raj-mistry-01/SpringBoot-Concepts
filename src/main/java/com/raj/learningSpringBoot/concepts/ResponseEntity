For an incoming http request what we send back to client is a reposne

What does response contains :
Status code
headers
body

order should be followed (boyd shoul be the las , because it follows the builder pattern internally)

ReponseEntity<T> is class


You can send a obj then How spring converts to reponseEntity??
You must have use RestController on top of it then only spring can

@RestController internal having @ReposnseBody so every return it will wrap up in reposneentity

Without it means

@Controller only this

return something -> spring will consider this as view
