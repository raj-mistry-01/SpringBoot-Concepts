async means  running parallel
async does not runs on the static method

sync method means
main thread called function f sync
means once f finishes till main is blocked then main contines

async means it will create a new thread for execution of f without blocking the main function further execution

@EnableAsync , @Async , @Bean( for custom executor)

So creating a new thread for a task does the async annotation

How the new thread is created

ThreadPoolExecutor , which  ThreadPoolExecutor ?

first spring find that any default executor exists or not

if finds any like you created in appconfig or anywhere it uses it create the threads and work the async tasks

if not then uses the default executor that is defined by java spring which is simpleAsynctaksexecutor

for custom threadpoolExecutor you have to use :
    actually it is ThreadPoolTaskExecutor in spring (wrapper of ThreadPoolExecutor in Java)


Async method run conditions :

- should be in different class from caller class
- public method

return something from async method to caller -> use future and completablefuture in caller
1. use get method to call the async method

Exception handling in async thread
1. in async method try catch method it self
2. in caller method either
3. spring boot async exception handler
